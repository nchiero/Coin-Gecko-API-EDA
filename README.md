# Coin-Gecko-API-EDA
In this project I used the Coin-Gecko API to get a overview of the current state of the Cryptocurrency Market.

# Key Findings

Bitcoin and Ethereum make up a major share of the market. Bitcoin alone makes up around 48% of the entire Cryptocurrency Market.

Crypto Currency is a very volatile asset. Since I had live data through the use of the API, as I was working through some of the volatility charts I was seeing massive changes in percent change in just hours. At the time of writing this Phoenix Global OLD was up over 5000% in the last 24 hours followed by Mobius which is up over 300 % in 24 hours. Both Pheonix old and Mobis have market caps around 25 Million which makes them very volatile to any price movement in both directions which makes them very risky. These types of coins are also not seen on normal crypto exchanges like CoinBase due to their risk which makes them harder to buy as well. During my analysis the entire market took a crash so I was able to see some big losses in price as well. Stronghold token alone was down 33% in 24 hours as well as many others down 25% from the day before. Looking at the 7 Day chart, Starship and Euphoria were down over 60% in the last 7 days! Looking at all coins in the last 7 days, only 112 of the 1000 coins had posted gains in the last 7 days. As with any investing, thereâ€™s a big risk and reward situation there for people willing to take it. Look at this data a few weeks ago during a heavy bull ruin, the gains would have far out weight the losses!


Most coins in the market are tiny regarding their market cap. 76% of coins were considered Nano or Micro meaning their market cap was less than 300 Million. A few years ago that might have been a big market cap, but now with bitcoin hovering around 1 trillion dollars, the field has really widened.

# Short Comings in Analysis
I would have liked to focus on a select group of the top coins on the market right now and build a price prediction model based on the Coin Gecko api data. I will be visiting this project in a few months to start working on building out these models after studying some more on what models for this would be best!
